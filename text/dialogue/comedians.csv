<name:36>How are YOU
doing?
<name:35>OK, enough. I've
been working too
much lately… I
want to be a kid
again…

<name:36>I know. When I
was a kid, all I
did was play.
I did all sorts
of mischief.

<name:35>Oh, yeah. Ding
ーDong Ditch…
<name:36>Yes! You knock
on someone's
door and before
they come out,
you run away!

<name:35>I did it
somewhat
differently. I
would disguise
myself so that
they wouldn't
know it was me.
Then I would
just knock on
the door and
run!

<name:35>How about
sticking a piece

tap on someone's
back when I was
saying 'Hi', and
secretly stick
the paper on
them.

5thーyear class
reunion the
other day, and
one guy still
had a paper I
put on his back.
