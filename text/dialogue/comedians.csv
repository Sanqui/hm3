<name>aI know. When I
was a kid, all I
did was play.
I did all sorts
of mischief.

<name>ZOh, yeah. Ding

<name>aYes! You knock
on someone's
door and before
they come out,
you run away!

<name>ZI did it
somewhat
differently. I
would disguise
myself so that
they wouldn't
know it was me.
Then I would
just knock on
the door and
run!
